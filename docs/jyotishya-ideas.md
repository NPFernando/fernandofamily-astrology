# Jyotishya feature ideas

A prioritized catalog of astrology-domain feature ideas for deepening Pancha
Pakshi, Daily Panchanga, and Bird Compatibility, plus genuinely new modules —
all grounded in what the pinned, vendored PyJHora V4.8.7 engine
(`apps/api/vendor/jhora/`, commit `ca22995`) can actually compute today.
Every idea below cites the real function or data file it stands on. Where the
engine can't honestly support an idea, or no verifiable source exists, that's
said plainly in Section E rather than glossed over — matching the standard
the Poya gazette validation (`docs/calculations/panchanga.md`) already set.

**A cross-cutting correctness note, found while researching this doc — now
resolved.** This doc originally flagged a discrepancy: `docs/calculations/
panchanga.md` described the module's ayanamsa as "the vendored engine's own
default (a Lahiri-family ayanamsa)," while the runtime config chain
(`apps/api/vendor/jhora/data/user_settings.json` → `"default_ayanamsa_mode":
"TRUE_PUSHYA"`, apparently loaded by `apps/api/vendor/jhora/config.py:
initialize_runtime`) suggested TRUE_PUSHYA instead. Neither turned out to be
what was actually running. Tracing the real call chain further: `config.py`'s
`initialize_runtime` is never actually invoked — `vendor/jhora/__init__.py`
references it as a bare attribute (`_config.initialize_runtime`, no `()`), a
no-op. Separately, `drik.py`'s own `set_ayanamsa_mode("TRUE_PUSHYA")` call
lives inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, equally never executed
on import. With nothing anywhere ever calling swisseph's `set_sid_mode`, the
engine silently ran on swisseph's compiled-in default the entire time:
**Fagan-Bradley** — not either previously-claimed value.

This has now been fixed and validated: the app explicitly configures
**Lahiri** (`apps/api/app/core/vendor_path.py`, `configure_ayanamsa`/
`ensure_ayanamsa`, called at both adapter-import time and at the top of
every calculator entry point — a single call site wasn't sufficient, see
that file's docstring). Lahiri was chosen because it matches the officially
published Sri Lankan New Year ("Aluth Avurudu") dawn instant — a real,
government-sourced, ayanamsa-sensitive ground truth — to within about a
minute across 2024, 2025, and 2026; see `apps/api/scripts/dev/
ayanamsa_newyear_check.py` and `docs/calculations/panchanga.md`'s Ayanamsa
section for the full derivation, and `apps/api/tests/test_ayanamsa.py` for
the regression guard. Fagan-Bradley (the accidental prior behavior) missed
by roughly a full day; TRUE_PUSHYA missed by over a day in the opposite
direction.

This resolves the ayanamsa question for every idea below that was gated on
it (flagged inline at the time this doc was written) — sidereal longitude,
rashi, and divisional-chart features can now proceed against Lahiri as a
settled, cited, cross-checked default, same as the rest of this app's
sidereal calculations.

## A. Deepening Pancha Pakshi

### A1. Tara Bala — daily star-strength overlay
**One-line:** For a user's birth Nakshatra, classify today (and any date) as
Good/Not Good/Very Good/Bad/Totally Bad, per the classical 9-fold tārābala
cycle.

**Engine feasibility:** Directly computable today. `thaaraabalam(jd, place)`
(`vendor/jhora/panchanga/drik.py:3518`) takes today's Nakshatra (already
computed by `nakshatra()`, used throughout Panchanga/Pancha Pakshi) and
returns, for every possible birth star 1–27, which of the 9 tārā categories
(Janma, Sampatha, Vipatha, Kshema, Pratyaka, Sadhana, Naidhana, Mitra,
Paramitra) it falls into relative to today. The 9-category good/bad mapping
is hardcoded in the function itself, not invented.

**Wiring note:** Pancha Pakshi's Method A/B already compute or accept a
birth Nakshatra transiently, but saved profiles currently persist only the
derived bird + paksha (`apps/api/app/modules/pancha_pakshi/models.py`), not
the birth Nakshatra itself — so this needs the birth Nakshatra retained on
the profile, not just re-derivation from scratch.

**Cultural grounding:** Tārābala is a standard, widely-published classical
technique (not vendor-specific); the good/bad category list matches common
published tables. No gazette-style independent dataset exists to validate
against — same honesty caveat as most panchanga content that isn't a
Sri Lanka government-published date.

**Effort:** M (engine call is trivial; UI + profile plumbing for birth
Nakshatra persistence is the real work).

### A2. Chandrashtama alert
**One-line:** Flag when the Moon transits the 8th sign from a user's natal
Moon sign — the classical "avoid new ventures" window — with exact
start/end.

**Engine feasibility:** Directly computable. `chandrashtama(jd, place)`
(`drik.py:3597`) returns the chandrashtama rashi and the exact JD the Moon
next changes sign (via `next_planet_entry_date`). Needs the user's natal
Moon rashi, obtainable via `raasi(jd, place)` (`drik.py:765`) at birth time —
not currently surfaced anywhere in the app today.

**Correctness caveat:** Uses the app's validated Lahiri ayanamsa (see the
top-of-file note) — no longer gated, but a rashi boundary right at a
transition is still, inherently, a close call regardless of ayanamsa.

**Effort:** S–M.

### A3. Disha Shool — travel-direction caution
**One-line:** "Avoid traveling [direction] today" — a classical
weekday-based directional taboo, shown alongside Pancha Pakshi's existing
"best windows today" card.

**Engine feasibility:** Trivial and self-contained. `disha_shool(jd, place)`
(`drik.py:3750`) is a pure lookup: `const.disha_shool_map[vaara(jd,place)]`.
No birth data needed at all — works for any date/place, same input shape as
the existing Rahu/Yamaganda/Gulika kalams.

**Cultural grounding:** A standard, table-driven Vedic travel convention;
verifiable against any published disha shool weekday table as a sanity
check, though (like the kalams) not independently gazette-validated.

**Effort:** S.

---

## B. Deepening Daily Panchanga

### B1. Eclipse & Grahan calendar — more feasible than the repo's own docs suggest
**One-line:** "Next solar/lunar eclipse visible from [place]", with contact
times and magnitude.

**Engine feasibility:** Already fully computable with **zero re-vendoring**.
`next_solar_eclipse`/`next_lunar_eclipse`/`is_solar_eclipse`
(`drik.py:2707`–`2798`) call Swiss Ephemeris's own
`swe.sol_eclipse_when_loc` / lunar equivalent directly, using the exact
ephemeris files already shipped in the Docker image (`sepl_18.se1` /
`semo_18.se1`, per `apps/api/vendor/README.md`). This directly contradicts
`apps/api/vendor/FUTURE_DATA_USES.md`'s second table, which lists
`panchanga/{vratha,eclipse,...}.py` as *not currently vendored* and needed
for "eclipse predictions for the Panchanga module" — that upstream module
may add Vedic-specific refinements (sutak-kaal windows, grahan-parva
classification), but raw, location-aware eclipse timing and magnitude is
already sitting in the vendored tree, unused. Worth correcting that doc.

**Cultural grounding:** The astronomical contact times/magnitude are Swiss
Ephemeris ground truth (as precise as the loaded ephemeris file — no
approximation). A traditional "sutak kaal" advisory window (commonly ~12h
before a solar eclipse's contact, ~9h before a lunar one) is a well-known,
citable classical rule that layers cleanly on top of the real contact time,
but should be labeled as a named traditional convention, not presented as
computed astronomy.

**Effort:** M (engine work is nearly free; UI for a rare, irregularly-timed
event needs its own design, and "visible from Sri Lanka" filtering needs
care — `sol_eclipse_when_loc` is already location-aware, but partial/very
low-magnitude events need a sensible visibility cutoff).

### B2. Choghadiya + Hora auspicious-time layer
**One-line:** Add Gauri Choghadiya (North Indian 8-part day/night auspicious
segments), Shubha Hora (South Indian 12-part planetary hours), Amrit Kaalam,
Abhijit Muhurta, and Durmuhurtam alongside the existing Rahu/Yamaganda/Gulika
kalams.

**Engine feasibility:** Directly computable today, same pattern as the
kalams already shipped. `gauri_choghadiya`, `shubha_hora`, `amrit_kaalam`,
`abhijit_muhurta`, `durmuhurtam` (`drik.py:1376`–`1525`) are all pure
functions of `sunrise()`/`sunset()`/`vaara()` — the exact same primitives
`trikalam()` (already wired via `panchanga/adapter.py:65`) uses. No new data
files, no re-vendoring.

**Cultural grounding:** Table-driven, widely-published day-segment systems
(`const.gauri_choghadiya_day_table`, `const.shubha_hora_day_table`, etc. are
baked into the vendored `const.py`) — cross-checkable against any published
Choghadiya/Hora table the same way the kalams already are.

**Effort:** S–M (mechanically identical to the existing Kalams feature).

### B3. Today's Graha positions + retrograde/stationary flags
**One-line:** A "sky today" panel — sidereal longitude and rashi for all 9
grahas, flagging any that are retrograde or stationary.

**Engine feasibility:** Directly computable. `planetary_positions(jd, place)`
(`drik.py:1529`) returns full planet positions; `planets_in_retrograde`
(`drik.py:331`) and `planets_in_stationary` (`drik.py:358`) are pure
`swe.calc_ut` speed-sign checks, no extra data needed.

**Correctness note:** Same as A2 — uses the app's validated Lahiri ayanamsa,
no longer gated.

**Effort:** S–M.

### B4. Moon Rashi of the day
**One-line:** Surface "Moon is in [Rashi] until [time]" directly — the same
treatment Nakshatra already gets.

**Engine feasibility:** Trivial — `raasi(jd, place)` (`drik.py:765`) is
already computed internally elsewhere in the engine but never exposed by
`panchanga/adapter.py` today. Same call shape as the existing `nakshatra()`
wiring.

**Effort:** S.

### B5. Ritu (season) and Samvatsara (60-year cycle name) badges
**One-line:** Add the Vedic season name and the 60-year Jupiter-cycle year
name (Prabhava…Akshaya) to the panchanga response.

**Engine feasibility:** `ritu(maasa_index)` (`drik.py:1369`) is pure
arithmetic on the lunar month index already computed
(`(maasa_index-1)//2`). `samvatsara(panchanga_date, place)` (`drik.py:1349`)
is also computable today.

**Correctness caveat — take this seriously:** `samvatsara()`'s own
docstring flags unresolved uncertainty: *"TODO: Chithirai always shows
previous year… Is there an algorithm for lunar samvatsara?"* This is the
vendored engine itself admitting an open question, not settled astronomy.
Ritu is safe to ship as-is; Samvatsara should either be held back until that
TODO is understood, or shipped with an explicit caveat rather than presented
as authoritative — exactly the "don't gloss over it" standard the Poya
divergence note already sets.

**Effort:** S (Ritu), S but gated on a decision (Samvatsara).

---

## C. Deepening Bird Compatibility

### C1. Vivaha Chakra Palan — wedding-date screener
**One-line:** For a candidate wedding date/place, return a 1–9 categorical
verdict on the day's own Sun–Moon nakshatra relationship (e.g. "Wonderful
pair and blessed" vs. "Devastating results for the girl") — a
muhurta-quality check for the date itself, distinct from and complementary
to Bird Compatibility's two-person bird lookup.

**Engine feasibility:** Directly computable. `vivaha_chakra_palan(jd, place)`
(`drik.py:3399`) computes the date's Sun and Moon nakshatra-pada, places
them on a 3×3 "marriage wheel" grid, and returns one of 9 fixed outcome
categories (the outcome text is hardcoded in the function's own docstring —
transcribed from the pinned commit, same handling `birth-bird.md` already
applies to the bird-mapping table).

**Cultural grounding:** The outcome categories are baked into the vendored
source itself (traceable to the exact pinned commit), but — unlike the Poya
day rule — no independent published dataset was found during this research
to cross-validate the 9-category outcome table against. Ship it labeled as
"per this engine's Vivaha Chakra method," not as an unqualified universal
truth, and don't claim gazette-style validation for it.

**Effort:** M (new small module or Compatibility sub-feature; the maths is
one function call).

*(Ashtakoot/Guna-Milan-style two-person nakshatra matching was also
investigated for this category — see Section E: it's not recommended as
things stand.)*

---

## D. Genuinely new modules (currently-unused vendored capability)

### D1. Divisional charts (Varga) explorer, built on birth details already collected
**One-line:** A Navamsa (D9) chart view, and more generally any of the D1–D60
divisional charts, computed from the same birth date/time/place already
captured by Pancha Pakshi's Method A.

**Engine feasibility:** The full varga system is already vendored and
working, just unused by the app. `dhasavarga(jd, place,
divisional_chart_factor=N)` (`drik.py:1806`) and `dasavarga_from_long`
(`drik.py:1740`) implement all of Hora(2), Drekkana(3), Chaturthamsa(4)...
Navamsa(9), Dasamsa(10), ... up to Shastyamsa(60), per the function's own
documented `divisional_chart_factor` table. This is the mathematical core of
a birth-chart/Kundali module, sitting fully implemented and unused.

**Correctness caveat:** No longer gated — the app now explicitly runs
validated Lahiri (see top-of-file note), the same convention most other
software/pandits compare against. A birth chart is still the highest-stakes
place to get the sidereal zero-point right, since users will screenshot and
compare it directly.

**Effort:** L (engine math is free; needs real chart-rendering UI, planet/
rashi iconography from `packages/design-system`, and a decision on which
vargas to expose first — D9 Navamsa is the highest-value single addition).

### D2. Fixed-star precision research (exploratory, not yet a defined product)
**One-line:** Use the retained-but-unshipped fixed-star catalogs for
star-based precision features (e.g., which fixed star a planet or the Moon
is conjunct tonight).

**Engine feasibility:** The data (`sefstars.txt`, `fixstars.cat`, ~250KB
combined, retained per `FUTURE_DATA_USES.md`) is not in the shipped Docker
image, but the underlying pyswisseph call is proven to work in this exact
vendored tree already — `swe.fixstar_ut("Citra", ...)` is called today
inside `vendor/jhora/utils.py:651` as part of the True Chitra ayanamsa
calculation itself. So the technical path is verified; what's missing is a
concrete, honest product surface (a "which star is the Moon near" widget is
a novelty more than a jyotishya practice most Sri Lankan readers will
recognize).

**Recommendation:** Don't build this without first identifying a specific,
named classical use for fixed stars (e.g. Chitra/Swati-based nakshatra
boundary precision) rather than a generic "fixed star finder." Treat as
research, not a scheduled feature.

**Effort:** L, and effort estimate is soft until a product use is defined.

## E. Explicitly not recommended

### E1. Vimshottari/other Dasha calculators
The project's own roadmap lists "Dasha calculations" as an unscheduled
future module, and `const.py` does carry extensive dasha *constants*
(`vimsottari_adhipati_list`, `human_life_span_for_vimsottari_dhasa`,
Ashtottari/Narayana/Kalachakra duration tables, `const.py:274`–`586`). But
the actual dasha **computation module** (`horoscope/dhasa/*.py` upstream) is
not vendored at all — and critically, unlike the vratha/eclipse modules,
it isn't even listed in `FUTURE_DATA_USES.md`'s "known, excluded, re-vendor
when needed" table. It wasn't part of the deliberate trim decision; pulling
it in means fresh upstream research beyond the documented safe process. Do
not attempt to reimplement dasha period math from the constants alone —
that's exactly the "inventing tradition without vendored ground truth" this
project's honesty bar exists to prevent. Re-vendor the real module and
golden-test it first, or don't ship it.

### E2. Ashtakoot / Guna-Milan two-person marriage-score matching
Real two-person nakshatra-matching (Gana, Tara, Yoni, Rasi, Rajju koota
scoring) is a natural extension of Bird Compatibility, and `const.py` even
carries the scoring thresholds (`compatibility_minimum_score_north/south`,
`mandatory_compatibility_south_list`, `const.py:701`–`705`). But a grep of
the entire vendored tree turns up **no computation function anywhere** —
only these threshold constants, no matching algorithm. Building a fake
"compatibility score out of 36" using just the category names, without the
real scoring rules, would be inventing methodology and presenting it as
authoritative — the opposite of the Poya gazette-validation standard this
platform holds itself to. Don't build this until the real matching module is
vendored.

### E3. Avurudu Nekath (Sinhala/Tamil New Year auspicious times)
Already correctly ruled out in `docs/calculations/panchanga.md` and
`docs/roadmap.md`: these are published annually as astrologer-panel PDFs
with no structured, computable dataset, and no calculation can be validated
against them. This research reaffirms that decision — nothing found in the
vendored engine changes it.

### E4. Generic "Horoscope of the Day" / predictive text
No specific finding drives this — it's a category call. Any feature that
generates personalized predictive or advice text not tied to a specific,
named, citable classical rule (like Tara Bala's fixed 9-category table, or
Vivaha Chakra Palan's fixed outcome table) would be fabricated content
riding on top of real computation, which is precisely the pattern this
platform's methodology pages exist to avoid. If a future idea in this space
comes up, it needs the same treatment as everything above: cite the rule,
cite the source, and say plainly when there isn't one.

### E5. ~~Shipping any new sidereal/rashi-dependent feature without resolving the ayanamsa discrepancy~~ — resolved
Was a gating item; no longer is. The engine explicitly runs Lahiri now,
validated against the officially published Sri Lankan New Year instant
across three years (see the top-of-file note and
`docs/calculations/panchanga.md`). A2, B3, B4, and D1 can proceed against
that as a settled default.
